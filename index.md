## About Me

I'm a software engineer based in New York. Before New York, I worked at a startup in Hangzhou. I moved to New York to study data science in NYU. After completing my studies, I spent a year as a research fellow focused on Algorithmic Fairness. I care about finding ways to co-evolve with the technology we create.

I'm drawn to multi-disciplinary problems. My interests span from hunting for ancient Egyptian astronomical texts in NYU's Bobst Library to cooking, spending time with my pets. I enjoy learning skills I'm not naturally good at! I'm also a guqin player and practice Chinese calligraphy.
