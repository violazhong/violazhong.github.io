## About Me

I'm a software engineer based in New York. I moved to New York to study data science in NYU CUSP. After CUSP, I did a one-year research followship with [New York City Commission On Human Rights](https://www.nyc.gov/site/cchr/index.page): I worked on AI policy and conducted independent research on fairness in Machine Learning. Before New York, I was the founding product and marketing team at [a startup](https://www.smartorder.ai/) in Hangzhou. I'm also a Guqinist, a Chinese calligrapher. When I'm not in front of a screen, I enjoy cooking and spending time with my pets.
