## About Me

I'm a software engineer based in New York. Before New York, I was part of the founding product and marketing team at [Smart Order](https://www.smartorder.ai/) in Hangzhou, China. I moved here to study data science in [NYU CUSP](https://engineering.nyu.edu/research/centers/cusp). After that, I spent a year as a research fellow with the [New York City Commission On Human Rights](https://www.nyc.gov/site/cchr/index.page), focusing on AI policy and fairness in machine learning. I care about finding ways to thoughtfully co-evolve with the technology we create.

When I'm not in front a screen, I'm a [Guqinist](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/500624), a [Chinese calligrapher](https://www.metmuseum.org/essays/chinese-calligraphy), and most importantly, the domestic leader of my pets. I enjoy cooking, hiking, pilates and yoga!
