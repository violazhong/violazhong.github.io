## About Me

I'm a software engineer based in New York. Before New York, I worked at a startup in Hangzhou. I moved to New York to study data science in NYU. After completing my studies, I spent a year as a research fellow focused on fairness in Machine Learning.

I'm also a Guqinist, a Chinese calligrapher. When I'm not in front of a screen, I enjoy cooking and spending time with my pets.
