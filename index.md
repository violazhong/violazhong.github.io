## About Me

I'm a software engineer based in New York. I came here to study data science in [NYU CUSP](https://engineering.nyu.edu/research/centers/cusp). Then I spent a year as a research fellow with the [New York City Commission On Human Rights](https://www.nyc.gov/site/cchr/index.page), focusing on AI policy and conducting independent research on [fairness in machine learning](https://fairmlbook.org/). Before New York, I was part of the founding product and marketing team at [Smart Order](https://www.smartorder.ai/) in Hangzhou, China. I'm also a [Guqinist](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/500624), a [Chinese calligrapher](https://www.metmuseum.org/essays/chinese-calligraphy). When I'm not in front of a screen, I enjoy cooking and spending time with my pets.
